## Authorisation

User auth has been implemented using the [excellent phx_auth library written by Aaron Renner](https://github.com/aaronrenner/phx_gen_auth).
The instruction provided by Aaron do not require any additional information (However some customisation will be done to support authorisation and multi-tenancy - see below)

## CSS

CSS has been imlemented using the [Tailwind library](https://tailwindcss.com/). I use the excellent TailwindUI addon and some config represents the use of these 
components/examples.
